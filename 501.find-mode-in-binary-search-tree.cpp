 *
 * Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the
 * most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
 * 
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * 
 * 
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal
 * to the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or
 * equal to the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example:
 * Given BST [1,null,2,2],
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠  1
 * ⁠   \
 * ⁠    2
 * ⁠   /
 * ⁠  2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * return [2].
 * 
 * Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the
 * implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
